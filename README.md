## Frontend Development

### Task Title: E-Library Management Frontend

### Description
Build the user interface for the E-Library Management Application using React. The frontend should allow users to browse, borrow, return, and search for eBooks, providing a responsive and user-friendly experience.

### Requirements:

- **Components**:
  - **Book Listing**: Display a list of available eBooks with filters for genre, author, and publication date.
  - **Book Detail View**: Show details of the eBook including title, author, genre, publication date, and an option to borrow or return the book.
  - **Forms**: Create forms for adding new books to the library or editing existing book details.
  
- **Styling**: Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material UI for a modern and engaging UI.
- **State Management**: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) or a state management library for handling app state and interactions.

### UI Reference:
- [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/)

## Backend Development

### Task Title: E-Library Management Backend

### Description
Develop the backend API for the E-Library Management Application using Node.js and Express. The API will handle user authentication, book management, and borrowing/returning operations.

### Requirements:
- **API Endpoints**:
  - **User Authentication**: Implement JWT-based user authentication for registration and login.
  
  - **Book CRUD Operations**:
    - **Create Book**: Endpoint to add a new book to the library.
    - **Read Books**: Endpoint to retrieve a list of books or a specific book by ID.

## Full-Stack Integration

### Task Title: E-Library Management Full-Stack Application

### Description
Integrate the frontend and backend components to create a complete, functional E-Library Management Application. Ensure smooth communication between the client and server for a seamless user experience.

### Requirements:
- **Integration**: Use Axios or Fetch API to connect the React frontend to the Node.js backend for user authentication and book management operations (borrow, return, etc.).
